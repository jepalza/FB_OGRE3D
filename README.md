# FB_OGRE3D

This is "wrapper" for V1.8.1 OGRE3D , called FLOW3D for BLIZTMAX, which until 2014 was commercial, but due to the little impact it had, its authors decided to release in 2015. Original version was 1.6.5

I include a demo of the game "JengaTower" from the author of FLOW3D, "Lina Adkins" that uses "newton" physics (OgreNewT)

Being a variant of OGRE, it uses the same system of plugins, DLLs and configuration files, as the original version from which it starts, the 1.6.5.
It is not easy to use, but it is a good basis for development.
